Web app to set the music and other features to create the perfect atmosphere to study or relax.

As a student, I want to use a productivity/study app that allows me to choose from different themes with different music and background so that I can create a personalized environment that helps me focus on my tasks.

When I open the app, I want to see a list of themes to choose from, each with a different background image and music playlist that fits the theme. For example, there could be a theme for studying in a coffee shop with background chatter and light jazz music, or a theme for studying in a library with the sound of turning pages and classical music.

Once I select a theme, I want to see a countdown timer that I can set to a specific time or use the default timer for a typical study session. I want to be able to pause and resume the timer if I need to take a break or get interrupted.

Throughout my study session, I want the app to play the music from the selected theme in the background, creating a calming and productive environment.

At the end of the timer, I want the app to notify me with a sound or message so that I can wrap up my work or take a break before starting another session.

Overall, I want this app to help me stay on track with my studies and increase my productivity by providing a personalized and calming environment for me to work in.
